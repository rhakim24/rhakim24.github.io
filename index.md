<h1>About Me!</h1>

  <h2>My name is Robiya 🙋🏻‍♀️</h2>
  <img src="me.png" alt="me at Amalfi Coast" style="width:150px;height:190px;">
  <h2>I'm a senior at USN and a super cool web developer. 👩🏻‍💻😎💅 I have a pet bird, a green-cheeked conure named Jonny. I'm his favorite person; we are inseparable.</h2>

  <h2>My Hobbies!</h2>
  <h2>I love a variety of things, such as:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>drawing</li>
    <img src="billieeilish.png" alt="billie eilish" style="width:125px;height:150px;"> 
    <h3>I've been drawing since I was five, and I always had a scketchbook and pencil with me wherever I went (road trips, movie nights, dinner table, etc.) Although I don't draw as avidly as I used to, I still draw in my freetime and have recently expanded my horizons into digital art.</h3>
    <li>painting</li>
    <img src="painting.png" alt="bird with fruits--frida kahlo" style="width:190px;height:150px;">
    <h3>I began painting at 8 years old when I went to a painting club outside of school in Brentwood. When I have more time to spare, I enjoy tuning out the world listening to music and painting.</h3>
    <li>playing with my bird</li>

    <h3>This is my beloved Jonny. We got him when I was 10 years old, and he will be 9 years old in June!</h3>
    <li>binging shows/movies</li>
    <img src="images.jpg" alt="Kagome from Inuyasha" style="width:150px;height:150px;"> 
    <h3>Inuyasha was my comfort show during quarantine. I began watching anime in 2019, and my first show was 'Maid-Sama!' I don't watch anime as frequently as before, but some that I'm currently watching are 'Spy x Family' and 'A Sign of Affection.' My favorite genres in general in no particular order are action, horror, psychological, and sometimes romance (depends on the trope, some can be overused/cliche).</h3>
    <li>going out with family and friends</li>
    <img src="gelato.png" alt="gelato" style="width:125px;height:150px;"> 
    <h3>I really love exploring my hometown and other places with family and friends. Going out with my loved ones makes the experience even better.</h3>
    <li>traveling</li>
    <img src="Milan.jpeg" alt="Milan, Italy" style="width:120px;height:150px;">
    <h3>I absolutely love traveling. My family has traveled a lot since I was little, so I can't handle being cooped up in one spot forever. Fun fact, we are also multilingual. We've been to 10 European countries (11 if you count Türkiye) and our home country, Uzbekistan.</h3>
  </ul>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our next project was the API project, and I chose an API key where you could search any European artist and it would show you a randomm artwork of theirs. Getting started was difficult because I had trouble understanding what exactly an API is, but now I have a better idea.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>After the API project, our next goal was to make our own graphics/webtool. I had lots of trouble trying to understand what that is and how programmers use them. I also didn't understand what kind of projects could be done with these webtools.</li>

</ul>

  <ul>
  <li>I think I have some idea of what to do now thanks to brainstorming projects with chatGPT--building a music player using Tkinter and pygame.</li>

  </ul>
